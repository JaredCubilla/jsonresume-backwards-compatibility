Convert your old [JSONResume](http://jsonresume.org/) into a valid 0.0.0 version.

## Usage

For those of you that still haven't updated your pre-release JSONResume to match the 0.0.0 schema, you're in luck... just use [this repository's website]() to convert your old invalid resume into a ready one.

It's pretty self-explanatory. Paste your old resume into the first textarea, click the big yellow button and like magic, a new resume all bright and shiny appears in the second textarea.

It's a work in progress, so bugs may occur. Please Github's built-in bug tracker to alert me of a bug. If you're feeling generous, please send a pull request for bug fixes, optimizations of my terrible code, or cool new features.
