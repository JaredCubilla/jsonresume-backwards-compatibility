# [backwards-compatibility](http://jaredcubilla.github.io/jsonresume-backwards-compatibility/)

Convert your old [JSONResume](http://jsonresume.org/) into a valid 0.0.0 version.

http://jaredcubilla.github.io/jsonresume-backwards-compatibility/

## Usage

For those of you that still haven't updated your pre-release JSONResume to match the 0.0.0 schema, you're in luck... just use [this repository's website](http://jaredcubilla.github.io/jsonresume-backwards-compatibility/) to convert your old invalid resume into a ready one.

It's pretty self-explanatory. Paste your old resume into the first textarea, click the big yellow button and like magic, a new resume all bright and shiny appears in the second textarea.

It's a work in progress, so bugs may occur. Please Github's [built-in bug tracker](https://github.com/JaredCubilla/jsonresume-backwards-compatibility/issues) to alert me of a bug. If you're feeling generous, please send a pull request for bug fixes, optimizations of my terrible code, or cool new features.

## TODO

- [ ] make volunteer and languages optional
- [ ] add support for `resume.json` files created in the middle of the initial schema and the 0.0.0 release
